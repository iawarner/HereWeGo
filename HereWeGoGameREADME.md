HereWeGoGame

HereWeGoGame is supposed to be like the lamest version of Skyrim you could possibly play.
Or any sword and shield, knight style game, anyway.

First, you input your name.
Then, you pick your weapon - a sword or a shield.
Then, you pick some stats,
but if you pick stats that are too low, you can't use your weapon.

Stats (out of 10):
1. strength (attack, carry)
2. defense
3. health

Then, you start the game.
Whenever you die, you can choose whether to start over
or to continue from right before you died.

You're on your way to be executed, and some dude tries to be your friend.
You choose whether or not to be his friend.  

When it's your turn to be executed, a dragon attacks the castle.
In the chaos, you are freed and begin to flee.
You can either follow the guy who was being friendly earlier,
or a guard from the castle.

You run into the castle with them.
You find some chests, and can loot them, but can only take one thing (sword, shield, or armor).
Your stats change depending on which one you pick (armor increases defense).

You run into some enemies who try to recapture you.
If you are with your friend from earlier, they are guards;
if you're with the guard, they are rebels.
You choose how to battle, and can die.
Health decreases depending on battle choices.

You go down some hallways, but have to turn back when the roof caves in
(you can make wrong turns and be crushed).

Finally, you come out in a turret, and have to either jump, or face the dragon.
Facing the dragon is death.
You land, and can either keep running, or follow your companion back into another keep.
Running is death.

Your friend opens a secret passageway, and takes you into caves.
You have to sneak around a bear, or attack it.
You have to fight it, if you attack it, potentially losing health.

Finally, you come out on the other side.
Your friend gives you a health potion, tells you there's a town nearby,
and ditches you.
